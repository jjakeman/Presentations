abstract="With uncertainty quantification, we aim to efficiently propagate the uncertainties in the input parameters of a computer simulation, in order to obtain a probability distribution of its output. In this work, we use multi-fidelity sparse grid interpolation to propagate the uncertainty in the shape of the incoming wave for the Okushiri test-case, which is a wave tank model of a part of the 1993 Hokkaido Nansei-oki tsunami. An important issue with many uncertainty quantification approaches is the `curse of dimensionality': the overall computational cost of the uncertainty propagation increases rapidly when we increase the number of uncertain input parameters. We aim to mitigate the curse of dimensionality by using a multifidelity approach. In the multifidelity approach, we combine results from a small number of accurate and expensive high-fidelity simulations with a large number of less accurate but also less expensive low-fidelity simulations. For the Okushiri test-case, we find an improved scaling when we increase the number of uncertain input parameters. This results in a significant reduction of the overall computational cost. For example, for four uncertain input parameters, accurate uncertainty quantification based on only high-fidelity simulations comes at a normalised cost of 219 high-fidelity simulations; when we use a multifidelity approach, this is reduced to a normalised cost of only 10 high-fidelity simulations.",

Abstract = {{We consider the numerical integration of multivariate functions defined
   over the unit hypercube. Here, we especially address the
   high-dimensional case, where in general the curse of dimension is
   encountered. Due to the concentration of measure phenomenon, such
   functions can often be well approximated by sums of lower-dimensional
   terms. The problem, however, is to find a good expansion given little
   knowledge of the integrand itself.
   The dimension-adaptive quadrature method which is developed and
   presented in this paper aims to find such an expansion automatically.
   It is based on the sparse grid method which has been shown to give good
   results for low- and moderate-dimensional problems. The
   dimension-adaptive quadrature method tries to find important dimensions
   and adaptively refines in this respect guided by suitable error
   estimators. This leads to an approach which is based on generalized
   sparse grid index sets. We propose efficient data structures for the
   storage and traversal of the index sets and discuss an efficient
   implementation of the algorithm.
   The performance of the method is illustrated by several numerical
   examples from computational physics and finance where dimension
   reduction is obtained from the Brownian bridge discretization of the
   underlying stochastic process.}},

abstract = "A key issue confronting petascale and exascale computing is the growth in probability of soft and hard faults with increasing system size. A promising approach to this problem is the use of algorithms that are inherently fault tolerant. We introduce such an algorithm for the solution of partial differential equations, based on the sparse grid approach. Here, the solution of multiple component grids are efficiently combined to achieve a solution on a full grid. The technique also lends itself to a (modified) MapReduce framework on a cluster of processors, with the map stage corresponding to allocating each component grid for solution over a subset of the processors, and the reduce stage corresponding to their combination. We describe how the sparse grid combination method can be modified to robustly solve partial differential equations in the presence of faults. This is based on a modified combination formula that can accommodate the loss of one or two component grids. We also discuss accuracy issues associated with this formula. We give details of a prototype implementation within a MapReduce framework using the dynamic process features and asynchronous message passing facilities of MPI. Results on a two-dimensional advection problem show that the errors after the loss of one or two sub-grids are within a factor of 3 of the sparse grid solution in the presence of no faults. They also indicate that the sparse grid technique with four times the resolution has approximately the same error as a full grid, while requiring (for a sufficiently high resolution) much lower computation and memory requirements. We finally outline a MapReduce variant capable of responding to faults in ways other than re-scheduling of failed tasks. We discuss the likely software requirements for such a flexible MapReduce framework, the requirements it will impose on users’ legacy codes, and the system's runtime behavior."

The construction of a sparse grid is recast into a knapsack problem: a profit is assigned to each hierarchical surplus and only the most profitable ones are added to the sparse grid. The convergence rate of the sparse grid approximation error with respect to the number of points in the grid is then shown to depend on weighted summability properties of the sequence of profits. This is a very general argument that can be applied to sparse grids built with any uni-variate family of points, both nested and non-nested. As an example, we apply such quasi-optimal sparse grids to the solution of a particular elliptic PDE with stochastic diffusion coefficients, namely the ``inclusions problem'': we detail the convergence estimates obtained in this case using polynomial interpolation on either nested (Clenshaw--Curtis) or non-nested (Gauss--Legendre) abscissas, verify their sharpness numerically, and compare the performance of the resulting quasi-optimal grids with a few alternative sparse-grid construction schemes recently proposed in the literature.",

abstract={While an experimental design for well-posed inverse linear problems has been well studied, covering a vast range of well-established design criteria and optimization algorithms, its ill-posed counterpart is a rather new topic. The ill-posed nature of the problem entails the incorporation of regularization techniques. The consequent non-stochastic error introduced by regularization needs to be taken into account when choosing an experimental design criterion. We discuss different ways to define an optimal design that controls both an average total error of regularized estimates and a measure of the total cost of the design. We also introduce a numerical framework that efficiently implements such designs and natively allows for the solution of large-scale problems. To illustrate the possible applications of the methodology, we consider a borehole tomography example and a two-dimensional function recovery problem.}

abstract={Design of experiments for discrete ill-posed problems is a relatively new area of research. While there has been some limited work concerning the linear case, little has been done to study design criteria and numerical methods for ill-posed nonlinear problems. We present an algorithmic framework for nonlinear experimental design with an efficient numerical implementation. The data are modeled as indirect, noisy observations of the model collected via a set of plausible experiments. An inversion estimate based on these data is obtained by a weighted Tikhonov regularization whose weights control the contribution of the different experiments to the data misfit term. These weights are selected by minimization of an empirical estimate of the Bayes risk that is penalized to promote sparsity. This formulation entails a bilevel optimization problem that is solved using a simple descent method. We demonstrate the viability of our design with a problem in electromagnetic imaging based on direct current resistivity and magnetotelluric data.}

    abstract = { We consider decision problems defined by a utility function and an underlying probability model for all unknowns. The utility function quantifies the decision maker's preferences over consequences. The optimal decision maximizes the expected utility function where the expectation is taken with respect to all unknowns, that is, future data and parameters. In many problems, the solution is not analytically tractable. For example, the utility function might involve moments that can be computed only by numerical integration or simulation. Also, the nature of the decision space (i.e., the set of all possible actions) might have a shape or dimension that complicates the maximization. The motivating application for this discussion is the choice of a monitoring network when the optimization is performed over the high-dimensional set of all possible locations of monitoring stations, possibly including choice of the number of locations. We propose an approach to optimal Bayesian design based on inhomogeneous Markov chain simulation. We define a chain such that the limiting distribution identifies the optimal solution. The approach is closely related to simulated annealing. Standard simulated annealing algorithms assume that the target function can be evaluated for any given choice of the variable with respect to which we wish to optimize. For optimal design problems the target function (i. e., expected utility) is in general not available for efficient evaluation and might require numerical integration. We overcome the problem by defining an inhomogeneous Markov chain on an appropriately augmented space. The proposed inhomogeneous Markov chain Monte Carlo method addresses within one simulation both problems, evaluation of the expected utility and maximization. }

    abstract = { Classical optimal design criteria suffer from two major flaws when applied to nonlinear problems. First, they are based on linearizing the model around a point estimate of the unknown parameter and therefore depend on the uncertain value of that parameter. Second, classical design methods are unavailable in ill-posed estimation situations, where previous data lack the information needed to properly construct the design criteria. Bayesian optimal design can, in principle, solve these problems. However, Bayesian design methods are not widely applied, mainly due to the fact that standard implementations for efficient and robust routine use are not available. In this article, we point out a concrete recipe for implementing Bayesian optimal design, based on the concept of simulation-based design introduced by Muller, Sanso, and De Iorio (2004). We develop further a predictive variance criterion and introduce an importance weighting mechanism for efficient computation of the variances. The simulation-based approach allows one to start the model-based optimization of experiments at an early stage of the parameter estimation process, in situations where the classical design criteria are not available. We demonstrate that the approach can significantly reduce the number of experiments needed to obtain a desired level of accuracy in the parameter estimates. A computer code package that implements the approach in a simple case is provided as supplemental material (available online). }

The minimization of the objective function in the classic A-optimal design is generalized to a Bayes risk minimization with a sparsity constraint. We present efficient algorithms for applications of such designs to large-scale problems. This is done by employing Krylov subspace methods for the solution of a subproblem required to obtain the experiment weights. The performance of the designs and algorithms is illustrated with a one-dimensional magnetotelluric example and an application to two-dimensional super-resolution reconstruction with MRI data.",

abstract={In this paper we propose and analyze a stochastic collocation method to solve
elliptic partial differential equations with random coefficients and forcing terms (input data of the
model). The input data are assumed to depend on a finite number of random variables. The method
consists in a Galerkin approximation in space and a collocation in the zeros of suitable tensor product
orthogonal polynomials (Gauss points) in the probability space and naturally leads to the solution of
uncoupled deterministic problems as in the Monte Carlo approach. It can be seen as a generalization
of the stochastic Galerkin method proposed in [I. Babuˇka, R. Tempone, and G. E. Zouraris, 
J. Numer. Anal., 42 (2004), pp. 800–825] and allows one to treat easily a wider range of situations,
such as input data that depend nonlinearly on the random variables, diffusivity coefficients with
unbounded second moments, and random variables that are correlated or even unbounded. We
provide a rigorous convergence analysis and demonstrate exponential convergence of the “probability
error” with respect to the number of Gauss points in each direction in the probability space, under
some regularity assumptions on the random input data. Numerical examples show the effectiveness
of the method.}
